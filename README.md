# FactoryIO-Non-stop-piece-log-toSQLServer
A new project combining TIA PORTAL V16, C# Windows Form Application, Microsoft SQL Server and Factory IO. Purpose is to log every piece to SQL server depending on its features.

I didn't upload anything related to SQL Server. You need to create your own database, table and related columns depending on the C# code. 

Here below youtube link how it looks like at the end.
